The final game of the Fifa World Cup 2014 has just finished. Italy has just beaten Brazil and all of the Italy fans are as happy as a kid in a candy shop and all that candy is free. As an Italy fan you are no exception and the body paint covering your head and torso seems to shine in the lights of the stadium. However the home fans can be categorized as nothing less than a furious angry mob. As the home fans start charging over to your side of the stadium you and the rest of the Italy fans start running for your lives. As you peer down at the field you can see the Italian soccer team also being chased down by a bunch of angry Brazilians and you can only hope that everyone is able to escape without injury. No matter how big this stadium is seeing that many people charging is a sight that would make any grown man tremble. After hiding in the bathroom for a little bit you walk out into the Concourse and see the angry mob of Brazilians running off into the street.

You stagger backwards and lift your arms to block yourself from another hit. As you get a better look at your assailant you gasp in surprise. It&apos;s El Sharaawy, your favorite player on the entire Italian team. As he realizes you&apos;re wearing Italian colors he rushes over to check on you. He explains that when the Brazil fans came charging the rest of the team ran but even though he was the fastest he knew hiding was a better option. You can&apos;t just leave him here alone. You have to take him with you but he&apos;s very adamant about staying. Time for you to do some fancy talking.

Stadium Concourse
The stadium concourse, you can see the angry mob of Brazillians running off into the distance. Around you there are food kiosks and booths selling booster wear for Brazil, Italy, and FIFA. There&apos;s also a trashcan, recycle bin, and trash on the ground. There&apos;s a garage to the north of you.

You can see Bottles, FIFA Booster Wear, Brazil Booster Wear, Italy Booster Wear and Trash here.

El Sharaawy arrives from the north.

Garage
The stadium garage. There are still tons of cars here, everyone must have just chosen to run instead of trying to drive off. You can see a fancy bus to the east of you and the Garage door probably leading outside to the west of you.

You stagger backwards and lift your arms to block yourself from another hit. As you get a better look at your assailant you gasp in surprise. It&apos;s El Sharaawy, your favorite player on the entire Italian team. As he realizes you&apos;re wearing Italian colors he rushes over to check on you. He explains that when the Brazil fans came charging the rest of the team ran but even though he was the fastest he knew hiding was a better option. You can&apos;t just leave him here alone. You have to take him with you but he&apos;s very adamant about staying. Time for you to do some fancy talking.

The stadium garage. There are still tons of cars here, everyone must have just chosen to run instead of trying to drive off. You can see a fancy bus to the east of you and the Garage door probably leading outside to the west of you.

You can see a Garage Door and a Ferrari (empty) here.
