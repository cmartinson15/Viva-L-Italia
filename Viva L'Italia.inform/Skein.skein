The final game of the Fifa World Cup 2014 has just finished. Italy has just beaten Brazil and all of the Italy fans are as happy as a kid in a candy shop and all that candy is free. As an Italy fan you are no exception and the body paint covering your head and torso seems to shine in the lights of the stadium. However the home fans can be catergorized as nothing less than a furious angry mob. As the home fans start charging over to your side of the stadium you and the rest of the Italy fans start running for your lives. As you peer down at the field you can see the Italian soccer team also being chased down by a bunch of angry Brazillians and you can only hope that everyone is able to escape without injury. No matter how big this stadium is seeing that many people charging is a sight that would make any grown man tremble. After hiding in the bathroom for a little bit you walk out into the Concouse and see the angry mob of Brazillians running off into the street.
