The final game of the Fifa World Cup 2014 has just finished. Italy has just beaten Brazil and all of the Italy fans are as happy as a kid in a candy shop and all that candy is free. As an Italy fan you are no exception and the body paint covering your head and torso seems to shine in the lights of the stadium. However the home fans can be categorized as nothing less than a furious angry mob. As the home fans start charging over to your side of the stadium you and the rest of the Italy fans start running for your lives. As you peer down at the field you can see the Italian soccer team also being chased down by a bunch of angry Brazilians and you can only hope that everyone is able to escape without injury. No matter how big this stadium is seeing that many people charging is a sight that would make any grown man tremble. After hiding in the bathroom for a little bit you walk out into the Concourse and see the angry mob of Brazilians running off into the street. You need to find a way out of the country or else who knows what will happen to you.

He explains that when the Brazil fans came charging the rest of the team ran but even though he was the fastest he knew hiding was a better option. You want to leave but you can&apos;t just leave him here alone. You have to take him with you but he&apos;s very adamant about staying.

Back Street
A dingy back street, unfitting of the World Cup. By the dim light of the one lamp post you can see multiple trash cans and trash bags lying around. Off in the distance you can hear the Brazillians yelling to each other. The Hotel is to your north and the garage is to the west.

You can see a Garage Door, Trash Cans, Cigarette butts and Bottles of Alcohol here.

Hotel Lobby
The hotel you&apos;re staying at, you have a room in one of the floors above. You can see a few Brazilians walking around patroling for Italian supporters like you before they move on, leaving one man to keep watch. You should think this through very carefully before making a move. Or not, but getting to your room would guarantee you some useful stuff. There is a bench, a computer, and some potted plants in the Hotel Lobby. You can see a park to the west of you and the street you just came off of to the east. Your room is above you.

You can see a Brazilian, a bench (empty), a potted plants and a computer here.

Just like Snake you creep around the Brazilians hiding in your box. As soon as you circle behind them you ditch the box pull out your pistol and let freedom ring on these poor souls before continuing on into the night.
An exclamation pops up on the top of the Brazilian&apos;s heads as they rush toward you.

The hotel you&apos;re staying at, you have a room in one of the floors above. You can see a few Brazilians walking around patroling for Italian supporters like you before they move on, leaving one man to keep watch. You should think this through very carefully before making a move. Or not, but getting to your room would guarantee you some useful stuff. There is a bench, a computer, and some potted plants in the Hotel Lobby. You can see a park to the west of you and the street you just came off of to the east. Your room is above you.

It&apos;s El Sharaawy, your favorite player on the Italian team. As he realizes you&apos;re wearing Italian colors he rushes over to check on you. He explains that when the Brazil fans came charging the rest of the team ran but even though he was the fastest he knew hiding was a better option. You want to leave but you can&apos;t just leave him here alone. You have to take him with you but he&apos;s very adamant about staying.

A dingy back street, unfitting of the World Cup. By the dim light of the one lamp post you can see multiple trash cans and trash bags lying around. Off in the distance you can hear the Brazillians yelling to each other. The Hotel is to your north and the garage is to the west.

Hotel Lobby
The hotel you&apos;re staying at, you have a room in one of the floors above. You can see a few Brazilians walking around patroling for Italian supporters like you before they move on, leaving one man to keep watch. You should think this through very carefully before making a move. Or not, but getting to your room would guarantee you some useful stuff. There is a bench, a computer, and some potted plants in the Hotel Lobby. You can see a park to the west of you and the street you just came off of to the east. Your room is above you.

A park. It&apos;s quiet and peaceful with not a single angry mob in sight. The leaves on the trees rustle in a peaceful manner, very different from how the rest of your night has been.

He explains that when the Brazil fans came charging the rest of the team ran but even though he was the fastest he knew hiding was a better option. You want to leave but you can&apos;t just leave him here alone. You have to take him with you but he&apos;s very adamant about staying.

Hotel
The hotel you&apos;re staying at, you have a room in one of the floors above. You can see a few Brazilians walking around patroling for Italian supporters like you before they move on, leaving one man to keep watch. You should think this through very carefully before making a move. Or not, but getting to your room would guarantee you some useful stuff. You can see a park to the west of you and the street you just came off of to the east. More descriptions later.

You can see a Brazilian here.

The harbor you can see the American ship a way off into the difference. It&apos;s to far to swim but you see a boat on the beach next to you.

Garage
The stadium garage. There are still tons of cars here, everyone must have just chosen to run instead of trying to drive off. You can see a fancy bus to the west of you and the Garage door probably leading outside to the east of you.

Bus
The Italian team&apos;s bus! Worried about the team you rush inside the bus to find it almost completely empty. As you move past the rows of comfortable seats you reach the back of the bus and find a pile of bags on the seats. The garage is to the east of you.

You stagger backwards and lift your arms to block yourself from another hit. As you get a better look at your assailant you gasp in surprise. It&apos;s El Sharaawy, your favorite player on the Italian team. As he realizes you&apos;re wearing Italian colors he rushes over to check on you. He explains that when the Brazil fans came charging the rest of the team ran but even though he was the fastest he knew hiding was a better option. You want to leave but you can&apos;t just leave him here alone. You have to take him with you but he&apos;s very adamant about staying. Time for you to do some fancy talking, maybe Asking him About coming with you would be helpful.

Back Street
A dingy back street, unfitting of the World Cup. By the dim light of the one lamp post you can see multiple trash cans and trash bags lying around. Off in the distance you can hear the Brazillians yelling to each other. More descriptions later.

Hotel
The hotel you&apos;re staying at, you have a room in one of the floors above. You can see a few Brazilians walking around patroling for Italian supporters like you before they move on, leaving one man to keep watch. You should think this through very carefully before making a move. Or not, but getting to your room would guarantee you some useful stuff. You can see a park to the west of you and the street you just came off of to the east.

You can see a Brazilian here.

An exclamation pops up on the top of the Brazilian&apos;s heads as they rush toward you.

Park
A park. It&apos;s quiet and peaceful with not a single angry mob in sight. The leaves on the trees rustle in a peaceful manner, very different from how the rest of your night has been. There&apos;s a gas can on the ground which is odd, I mean seriously, it&apos;s a gas can in the middle of a park. There looks to be a harbor to the west of you and the hotel to your east..

Harbor
The harbor you can see the American ship a way off into the difference. It&apos;s to far to swim but you see a boat on the beach next to you. As you move toward the boat your hope grows and El Sharaawy sprints towards it. As you reach it you find that there is a major problem, it has no gas. The park is to the east of you. More descriptions coming later. You should probably try combining something with the boat. The part is to the east.

You can see a Gasless Boat (empty) here.
